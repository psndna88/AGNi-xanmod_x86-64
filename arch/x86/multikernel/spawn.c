 * This implements the spawn trigger mechanism for multikernel. When a spawn
 * kernel needs to be started on a pool CPU:
 *
 * 1. The pool CPU is waiting in multikernel_play_dead() with APIC enabled
 * 2. Host calls mk_spawn_cpu() which sets spawn context and sends IPI
 * 3. The CPU wakes from halt, checks spawn context, and jumps to trampoline
 * 4. Trampoline switches page tables and jumps to spawn kernel
 *
 * For secondary CPU bringup in spawn kernel:
 * - Reuse the same spawn context from primary boot
 * - Update entry point to secondary_startup_64
 * - Reuse identity page tables and trampoline
